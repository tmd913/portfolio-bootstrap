            Hi! My name is Tom, and I was born and raised in Wyomissing, PA (about an hour NW of Philadelphia). Throughout my childhood
            I was always a bit of a nerd, especially when it came to technology. I was super into phones, computers, videogame
            consoles, and any other electronics I could get my hands on. Although I loved various forms of technology, I
            never really understood how any of them worked.
        </p>

        <p>
            I got my first major exposure to the software on these devices during an introductory Computer Science course during my sophomore
            year at the University of Richmond, and I liked the material so much that I decided to major in Computer Science.
            Majoring in Computer Science was a long and bumpy road, and while I did like my classes, I ultimately decided
            to pursue a consulting job after graduation rather than enter the technology industry.
        </p>

        <p>
            My first job in consulting led me to Washington, DC, and although after about a year I realized that the consulting world
            was not for me, I learned a lot about myself during the process and ended up in a city that I love. I am extremely
            excited to get back into the technology industry after this boot camp, and I am very optimistic that down the
            road I will find my dream job using the skills that I develop throughout the next several months!
        </p>
